This layer's job is to handle not only domain resolution but client/server
validation.

That is, when a client identifies itself to pIrcd as a user or server, the
system will ask this layer whether it is ok for the user to signon or not.

Resolving their host, doing an ident check, making sure they aren't coming
from an open socks server or banned host is all the job of this layer.

Currently it can only do DNSes and the communication methods aren't yet
complete.

Perhaps we should be using the ADNS library and unix domain sockets so
these processes can be controlled by the admin rather than having them
forked off the main process.

Additionally, oper and server link authenticators are to be validated by
an appropriate module in this layer.  Traditionally, opers and servers are
authenticated by passwords, however this layer should eventually support
use of client and server x.509 certificates.

In the future, this layer will be called, the 'authentication layer'.
