This layer's duty is to handle the actual parsing of IRC messages
from both clients and servers.

It is this layer that needs to deal with protocol intracacies and
extentions with clients.

With servers, only the internal protocol need be supported for now,
but it would be a plus to leave the possibility open for linking with
`older servers', however the extentions are very likely to make pIrcd
fundamentally incompatible with traditional IRC.
