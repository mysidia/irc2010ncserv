The job of this layer is to manage the internal structures of the irc daemon,
particularly the lists of things ircd has to keep track of, user settings,
the hash table for local users and channels.

Additionally, all routines for handling the 'global registry' currently fall
under this layer, although they should be in separate layers.
[channels, nicks, etc]
