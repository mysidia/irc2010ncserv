The purpose of the port layer is to take care of the OS-specific things
that ircd needs to do, that is, they should provide common interfaces
for the OSes that have non-standard interfaces, so that the rest of the
code simply ends up calling a port hook rather than the OS' broken
or non-existent function.

In many cases the routines provided by this layer override the OS routines,
so hopefully behavior isn't greatly dependent on the particular libc in use.
