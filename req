REQUIREMENTS of pIRCd
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             * communications protocol(s) should be completely found within
               their own library/layer.

             * Even in non-rfc-client mode, the Daemon needs to be
               mostly compatible with mIRC, ircII, and pIrch; that is,
               those clients should be capable of functioning, not-
               necessarily using all the features -- this can be
               implemented through a 'proxy', however (a program the
               user needs to run on their computer to make an old client
               work).

             * pIrcd must implement a distributed, integrated services model

             * pIrcd must implement a distributed database mechanism for
               nick and channel mapping.
